Speed test app created for testing page loading times for EnterCampaign to LP.

## Usage

It's just a basic website with one page. Use Grunt or cli tools to compile jade and coffeescript.

I use [harpjs](http://harpjs.com) to run and compile since it's ridiculously easy to compile and/or test. To install run `npm i -g harp`

### Using harp

#### Testing

```bash
harp server
```

#### Compiling

```bash
harp compile
```

<small>Now you should see a www directory with the compiled sources</small>
